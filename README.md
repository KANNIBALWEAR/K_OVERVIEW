- RESEARCH THE SLANG (AOKU HAS SOME GOOD EXAMPLES OF PROPER NAMING)

People wearing your techwear are called "carriers" (virus, disease motive).


'First, start with the jacket. All great techwear outfits are built on outerwear, full stop. As a general rule, the best tech jackets are waterproof, durable, and designed for movement, ideally wrapped in a neutral color. In general, err towards GORE-TEX fabrics and zippers in key areas.

Second, build functional layers. The best tech jacket is only as good as what’s underneath. Our recommendation: go for a slouchy extended tee under a warm mid-layer, ideally a goose down jacket or high-tech fleece. In the outdoors industry, this is referred to as the “base-mid-shell” system.

This three-layer design ensures rapid adaptability both inside and out.

Next, do the details. The difference between “technical athleisure” and true techwear rests in high-function features like hidden vents, specialized pockets, and taped seams. In many ways, these tech details differentiate techwear from scaled-down looks like athleisure or sportswear.

Just look at a pair of Guerilla Group pants vs. your athleisure cargoes from H&M: both are black, tapered, and heavy on pockets, but only one drips the sort of utility features (articulated joints, intersecting seams, water-repellant coating) that mark it “techwear.”

Finally, focus on footwear. Even with space-age layers and every detail in line, the wrong shoes can throw off your vibe entirely. As a general rule, choose sneakers either made of cutting-edge materials (Flyknit, Primeknit, neoprene, etc.) or have visible “tech” features that supplant their more humble construction (ex. a leather sneaker with a zipper entry)."

1. Technical hardshell. The cornerstone of all techwear outfits. The right hardshell jacket will keep you dry through 3 hours of winter precipitation and even stay breathable during activity. Try getting that from a peacoat.

2. Performance mid-layer. Most technical shells lack insulation by design, leaving the warmth factor up to a user’s individual needs. Layer a performance mid-layer under your jacket for the ultimate in customized insulation.

3. Extended tee. Fashion, function, and lightweight style. The base layer that cover all your bases.

4. Weather-ready backpack. Built for a high-mobility urban lifestyle. Bring everything you need with you without frying your laptop when it rains. Even better, do it in style.

5. State-of-the-art sneakers. Athletic shoes have long pushed the envelope for performance design. While some sneakers are content to push, others choose to shove. 

6. Techwear pants. One of the only styles of fashion where cargo pants are king."
